Who knows what to even call this desire? You see other people bending machines
and the net to their will starting with no more creativity than you have. They
just know stuff. Programming? Becoming technical? 

* Only a vague notion of what you're looking for?
* Don't know language A from B?
* Getting conflicting but trusted advice?
* I propose one oddly argued path forward..

Levinux is a tiny virtual server that runs on the desktop of Macs and Windows
PCs with a double-click, so that you can begin to fearlessly play around with
"server stuff".

- No installation is required .red[*]

- No admin rights required

- Resets on-demand to original state

- Start programming Python immediately.

- Play around fearlessly.

- Gain superpowers.

.footnote[.red[*] Just unzip the file]

Everything is becoming possible so fast. But what of you? Are you just a user
of all this wonderful tech, or can you have a hand in creating it?

---

Do you need a lifetime of training? Or can a relative amateur (or neewb) jump
in and make a significant contribution? How can you make the first small step
and feel some power? Easy: control your very own server!

---

That's a computer, generally running 24x7, not meant to run consumer software
or mobile apps, but rather, things you've written to do your bidding. It's a
power kick and an enlightening experience. Let's get started.

---

Step 1 is to reduce the number of things you need to know and of those that
remain make sure they're as timeless as possible so you don't have to keep
relearning (and re-buying) everything every 2 to 5 years.

---

This comes wire the difficult realization that everything with a graphical user
interface and provided by for-profit vendors will require you to constantly
re-learn and re-buy merely to keep the progress you've made. Plus, you'll be
locked into their platforms.

---

The alternative is the text-based environment that actually underlies
everything from phones to drones and everything in between. Whenever a generic
general purpose computer is built into things, they pretty much get programmed
similarly.# Welcome to Levinux
