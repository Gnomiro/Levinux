# Welcome to Levinux

Everything is becoming possible so fast. But what of you? Are you just a user
of all this wonderful tech, or can you have a hand in creating it?

---

Do you need a lifetime of training? Or can a relative amateur (or neewb) jump
in and make a significant contribution? How can you make the first small step
and feel some power? Easy: control your very own server!

---

That's a computer, generally running 24x7, not meant to run consumer software
or mobile apps, but rather, things you've written to do your bidding. It's a
power kick and an enlightening experience. Let's get started.

---

Step 1 is to reduce the number of things you need to know and of those that
remain make sure they're as timeless as possible so you don't have to keep
relearning (and re-buying) everything every 2 to 5 years.

---

This comes wire the difficult realization that everything with a graphical user
interface and provided by for-profit vendors will require you to constantly
re-learn and re-buy merely to keep the progress you've made. Plus, you'll be
locked into their platforms.

---

The alternative is the text-based environment that actually underlies
everything from phones to drones and everything in between. Whenever a generic
general purpose computer is built into things, they pretty much get programmed
similarly.# Welcome to Levinux
