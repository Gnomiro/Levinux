# Welcome to Levinux
[A tiny virtual machine to learn on]

## So, you want high-tech Super Powers?
---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Don't know where to start?
]
.right-column[
What do you even call this desire? You see other people bending machines to
their will starting with no more creativity than you have. They just seem to
know stuff. Programming? Being technical? 

* Why rely on others? You want this power for yourself!

* But only a vague notion of what you're looking for.

* Maybe you think you're too old to learn new tricks.

* Or you think you're too young to learn old tricks!

* Getting conflicting advice from trusted sources?

* And what about mobile apps vs. Web vs. other?

* And the whole Mac vs. PC vs. Linux thing?

* Oh, and then there's the Cloud.

* And choice of Language.

* Aaaaarrg!

## Could there even possibly be a right answer?
---

## Yes! Well, sort of...
Old-skool provides one reasonable approach.

.left-column[
  ## Why Old-Skool Is Cool
]
.right-column[
Anything with a graphical user interface is generally tied to a particular
hardware platform and particular shapshot in time. All that knowledge is going
to become antiquated. Games. Mobile. Desktop software. All but the back-end. .red[*]

* Back-end code can be a lot cooler than you think.

* It's also easier than you think, thanks to Python.

* And yeah, we'll be learning JavaScript too.

* And the revision control system called git.

* And the text editor called vim.

* And some *nix commands.

* And text terminals.

.footnote[.red[*] Back-end code runs on servers, not browsers.]

## I call it the Short Stack
*Nix + Python + vim + git
---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Short Stack?
]
.right-column[
Sounds intimidating? It's actually the LEAST software you could be using to do
interesting things. Oh yeah, it's all free and open source software (FOSS) and
you can get it all in an instant with Levinux. Then ditch Levinux. .red[*]

* Anything that can run Python can be a server.

* Add to it a way to get your code around (git)

* Add to it a way to create your code (vim)

* Discover the timelessness of these tools.

* Become impervious to disruption.

* And un-beholden to vendors.

* Code long and prosper!

.footnote[.red[*] Think of Levinux as a gateway drug.]

## Boooooooooring!
Well, yes. And no.

layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Reality Check
]
.right-column[
What fun or good is back end programming if its only machines talking to
machines? At some point you need the User Interface (UI) and User Experience
(UX) in order to interact with real human beings and do useful things.

* We're going to learn how to program JavaScript too.

* And HTML5, CSS and other web browser technologies.

* JavaScript is nice for coding that UI/UX stuff.

* But it's still best to also know Python.

* You won't see why until you see why. .red[*]

* So, we'll get your code running here.

* Then we'll make sure it's useful.

* Then install it elsewhere.

## Achieving Mastery Is Possible
The Short Stack is like a violin or carpenter's tools...
---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Timeless Tools
]
.right-column[
The least amount of software that can run in the most places, and let you do
the most interesting things across the most fields. All this, without you
needing to be a career programmer, or much risk of obsolescence..

* *Nix includes Unix, Macs, and Windows with MinGW.

* Mind boggling range of hardware your code runs on.

* Python is a language loved by newbs and pros alike.

* vim is a text editor you'll at first hate, then love.

* git lets you backup, move and share code.

* Levinux is like a disposable server.

* Terminals let us log into servers.

* Browsers give UIs to our apps.

* Little enough to master.

.left-column[
  ## Alternatives
]
.right-column[
There's countless ways to learn programming and tech. Many are more more
mainstream, aligned with vendors, their hot hardware platforms, and could get
you better keywords on your resume and larger salaries sooner.

* The "enterprise" platforms are .NET (C#) and Java.

* These align to Microsoft and Oracle, respectively.

* Which use Visual Studio and Eclipse for IDEs. .red[*]

* There's also Apple with Objective C and Xcode.

* And there's Google's Android that uses Java.

* Those are necessary for native mobile apps.

* Plus, there's Ruby, PHP and a ton of others.

* So, learn whatever else you need to.

* And learn the Short Stack here.

## What precisely is Levinux?
I'm just connecting a few dots (that were long-overdue)
---
layout: false
.left-column[
  ## Under The Hood
]
.right-column[
Levinux is a tiny virtual server that runs on the desktop of Macs, Windows and
Linux PCs (like Ubuntu) with a double-click, so that you can begin to
fearlessly play around with "server stuff".

* There's no installation or admin rights required .red[*]

* Built on QEMU and Tiny Core Linux free software.

* It's a legit server -- you learn the real thing.

* Can be shut-down safely by just clicking out.

* Runs well from Dropbox and USB drives.

* Portable development environment.

* It's easily reset it to its original state.

* Gateway drug to real hardware.

* Your code survives.

.footnote[.red[*] Just unzip the file & deal with web safety warnings]

.left-column[
  ## A Swiss Army Knife of Tech
]
.right-column[
Since Levinux is only Tiny Core running on the PC emulator called QEMU with a
custom start script, it could be modified as a template for efficiently
distributing any sort of web alliance, such as ready-to-run Github projects.

* The Recipe.sh start-script can build any type of server.

* The recipe can be edited on the host (the Mac or PC).

* You can pick it apart and modify any way you like.

* It's an efficient way to distribute web appliances.

* Recipes are easily adapted to real hardware.

* Raspberry Pi's can use these recipes. .red[*]

* Learn with Levinux, then move on.

* Pocket knives only do so much,

* but are still nice to have.
